# ajax-with-djago
I wanted to learn more about ajax in Django and everything I knew; writed it here with every commit and each episode of that course.
There is a .txt file that i writed every episode of codes in that file and I explained what i did in this project for myself ,but it is in finglish(Persian) languege :))
